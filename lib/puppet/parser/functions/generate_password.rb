module Puppet::Parser::Functions
  newfunction(:generate_password, :type => :rvalue, :doc => <<-ENDDOC
Returns a generated, plaintext password. The value returned is suggested
for use as a first-time password when setting up a new user account, and
is not likely to be memorable by a human.

*Examples:*

    generate_password()

will return a generated password, with a length of #{MIN_LENGTH} characters.

    generate_password(16)

will return a generated password, with a length of 16 characters.

If the argument provided to this function cannot be converted to an integer value,
or if is convertable to an integer with a value lower than #{MIN_LENGTH}, will return a
generated password, with a minimum length of #{MIN_LENGTH} characters.

The password will include at least one character from each of three character classes:
digits (0-9), lowercase letters (a-f only), and a set of special characters, '#{SPECIAL_CHARS_PRINTABLE}'
